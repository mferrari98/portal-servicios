# Production-Ready Polish

## Why
The portal needs to be production-ready for deployment across different systems. Current state lacks comprehensive documentation, has minor UI inconsistencies (tooltip colors), and needs better organization for code reusability and design system documentation.

## What Changes
- Fix tooltip colors to use new color palette (green #00a54f instead of orange)
- Create comprehensive README.md with tech stack and installation guide
- Create DESIGN_SYSTEM.md documenting design patterns, colors, and components for reuse across projects
- Review and update CLAUDE.md for accuracy
- Clean up unused component files (avatar.tsx, dropdown-menu.tsx - not being used)
- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and deployment-ready

## Impact
- Affected specs: portal-ui
- Affected code:
  - src/App.tsx (tooltip colors)
  - README.md (new file)
  - DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (new file)
  - CLAUDE.md (review and updates)
  - src/components/ui/ (cleanup unused components)
- No breaking changes
- Improves developer experience and deployment process
